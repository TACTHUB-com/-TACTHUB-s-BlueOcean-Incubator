#TACTHUB's BlueOcean Incubator

We're redefining how we can take charge of our own impact driven careers in this new era! Our BlueOcean Incubator is a global digital incubator that builds upon blue ocean economical strategies--rather that what occupies—most of our systemic world today; red ocean strategies. 

Strategy aside, we believe in rapid prototyping with communities. CONTEXT is KING and there's no rest for the wicked! We challenge norms in impact financing models, governmental reform in digitalization, to how—we as users—consume and react to cognitive manipulation. 

Interested? Join one of our BlueOcean working groups and work with sustainability leaders from all sectors and fields. We guarantee a hyper-sprint of cross-field learning that you've not experienced before!
